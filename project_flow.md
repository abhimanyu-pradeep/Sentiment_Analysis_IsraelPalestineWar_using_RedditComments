Translation:

Amen. Kill jews and continue gazan oppression!
Friendly fact reminder: Israel has been stealing Palestines land, bombing their civilians, controlling their access to water/food and kidnapping Palestinian civilians for over 50 years. Israel has  been committing genocide on Palestine but somehow people like you like to place the blame on Palestine. If you think Hamas is bad, I have some bad news about the IDF for you.
Well, i would never support Hamas, but there actions Israel could do that would make me stop supporting it: State orginized killing of Israeli or west bank Arabs or use of Atomic weaponary.

There is absolutely evidence of Hamas taking Captagon - a drug similar to Pervitin, which the Nazis took - and itâ€™s been reported by multiple outlets.

https://nypost.com/2023/10/23/hamas-terrorists-were-high-on-poor-mans-cocaine-report/amp/
Do you have the avtual link to the new york times? Because I looked at it and they said hamas didnt give them any evidance. All of of this is just lies
I didn't deny anything you said.

I said Israel doesn't use human shields and Gaza does. Which is a fact.

You chose to change the subject to Israel having locals in Gaza deliver messages for them years ago. The behavior you're complaining about ceased.

So what was the point of bringing it up when I said Israel doesn't use human shields and Gaza does? Just as a distraction?
&gt;Yes, exactly, Hamas attacked, not the 1 million kids in Gaza. No amount of capslock or invoking of October 7th is gonna make murdering kids ok

Which makes all of that Hamas's fault.  EVERY death since October 7th, by bullet, bomb, every single kid who dies, is Hamas's fault.

That's why in the United States if you're part of a 3 person bank robbery, every person who dies is a murder that is on your hands.  Even the 2 other people who are with you, if they get shot by a security guard, that's a murder charge for you, because you're the one responsible for everything that happened as a result of you taking a gun into a bank to commit a robbery.

The safety of every child in Gaza was Hama's responsibility, and they willingly put all of those lives in jeopardy when they attacked Israel.  So spare us all the equivocation and acting like all of this is suddenly some evil that the Israeli's are perpetrating on the innocents of Gaza ... Hamas could stop all of this at any moment if they wanted to, all they'd have to do is lay down their weapons, release their hostages, and surrender to be judged for their crimes on October 7th.

If you want to complain about the innocent lives being lost in Gaza, complain to Hamas, because every death that has occurred in battle since October 7th has been Hamas's fault.
Firstly, even in the best scenario you are confusing "Gazans" with "Palestinians", which is particularly disgusting since Israelis are doing unjustifiable attacks on West Bank Palestinians right now.

Secondly, even if we knew that 99% of Gazans support Hamas, it would still be bad to think in this way, because it does not allow for even the possibility of peace without ethnic cleansing.

The distribution of geopolitical stances on the Israel-Palestine issue within the dataset is as follows:

Neutral/Stance Not Clear: This category comprises the majority with 286,000 instances, indicating that a significant portion of the data does not express a clear position on the Israel-Palestine issue.

Against Israel/Palestine: There are 123,092 instances where the stance opposes Israel, Palestine, or both. This reflects a substantial segment of the dataset expressing negative sentiment or opposition towards the parties involved.

Supports Palestine: There are 13,911 instances where the stance supports Palestine. While fewer in number compared to neutrality and opposition, this segment represents a notable portion of the dataset that favors the Palestinian side.

Supports Israel: There are 13,722 instances where the stance supports Israel. Similar to supporting Palestine, this segment is smaller but significant within the dataset, indicating support for the Israeli side.

INFERENCE:

Neutral/Stance Not Clear: The largest group, indicating that most of the dataset does not take a definitive stance on the Israel-Palestine issue.


Against Israel/Palestine: A substantial number of instances express opposition or negative sentiment towards Israel, Palestine, or both.


Supports Palestine: Represents a smaller but notable segment supporting the Palestinian side.


Supports Israel: Also a smaller but significant segment expressing support for the Israeli side.


This breakdown underscores the diversity of opinions within the dataset regarding the Israel-Palestine conflict, with a significant portion not clearly stating a stance, and a slightly higher number leaning towards opposition compared to support for either side.
