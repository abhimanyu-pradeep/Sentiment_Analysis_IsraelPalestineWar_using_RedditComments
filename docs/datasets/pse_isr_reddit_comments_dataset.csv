You chose to change the subject to Israel having locals in Gaza deliver messages for them years ago. The behavior you're complaining about ceased.

k70v865,1,"&gt;Yes, exactly, Hamas attacked, not the 1 million kids in Gaza. No amount of capslock or invoking of October 7th is gonna make murdering kids ok

Which makes all of that Hamas's fault.  EVERY death since October 7th, by bullet, bomb, every single kid who dies, is Hamas's fault.

That's why in the United States if you're part of a 3 person bank robbery, every person who dies is a murder that is on your hands.  Even the 2 other people who are with you, if they get shot by a security guard, that's a murder charge for you, because you're the one responsible for everything that happened as a result of you taking a gun into a bank to commit a robbery.

The safety of every child in Gaza was Hama's responsibility, and they willingly put all of those lives in jeopardy when they attacked Israel.  So spare us all the equivocation and acting like all of this is suddenly some evil that the Israeli's are perpetrating on the innocents of Gaza ... Hamas could stop all of this at any moment if they wanted to, all they'd have to do is lay down their weapons, release their hostages, and surrender to be judged for their crimes on October 7th.

If you want to complain about the innocent lives being lost in Gaza, complain to Hamas, because every death that has occurred in battle since October 7th has been Hamas's fault.",IsraelPalestine,2023-10-29 23:55:08+00:00

The government can‚Äôt do shit without a population of people who let them. 

Arab people have the inherent right as human beings to tell their government what to do, and if they don‚Äôt, to yeet them out of power. 

Although it is a running joke that American individuals own too many advanced weapons that they we sometimes use on each other, the but *reason* we actually have those is because we know and truly believe in our souls that we have every goddamn right to **overthrow our government. 


Step 1. Stop utilizing death and maiming as a first response to conflict. Y‚Äôall have too many very young people that are exploited over and over by a very teeny tiny number of very old very rich people that have consolidated and the control of all the wealth. Death should NOT be the immediate consequence for bad behavior or conflict. 

Step 2. Arab people should force your governments to unite under a banner of ‚ÄúArab Unity‚Äù and put aside internal and external religious conflicts. Again, you have too many young people. Stop allowing young adults to fight. Children should never fight anyway, neither should any Arab from the ages 18-45 right now. If a fight needs to be had, the filthy rich old people who have all the money who use young adult to fight on their behalf should use themselves as fighters and then when they‚Äôre dead, the 18-45 year olds and the rest of the older non filthy rich should take that money and use it for Step 3-5. 

Step 3. Empower civilians through providing an advanced secular universal educational curriculum for all girls and boys that focuses on STEM. 

Step 4. Create an environment of creativity and fund those now educated young men and women to create valuable industries that produce products and services that can both raise the Arab people up economically but also a resource that no one else has to export or trade for valuable imports. *My suggestion* is ANTI-AGING AND MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY as The West has a whole bunch of old people with a lot of money to spend on not being old, and Arab nations have a whole bunch of young people who have a lot time left on the clock to think of how use that as their advantage. 

Step 5. When one nation is dependent on another for valuable imports that nation becomes a ‚ú®valuable ally‚ú®, and just like magic, that new alliance and their thoughts and concerns suddenly become very important and their best interests become better protected and enforced.

You can criticize Israel, and there are legitimate reasons to, but leaving out Hamas is naive and ignorant.

This is a group that, when Israel was negotiating a peace deal, launched suicide bombing attacks against Israeli civilians to try to derail the peace talks. This is a group that, when Israel left Gaza and pulled out its settlers, attacked its fellow Palestinians in control of Gaza and took over, then began firing rockets at Israel prompting an Israeli-Egyptian blockade. They were never interested in peace.

All Palestinians didn't participate in a terrorism of 7 October, nor are they doing ""Jihad"". That would literally be impossible.

(Again, please note that al-Qaeda and bin-Laden don't represent Muslims.)

Again, you are making the astounding error of impugning the entire people of Palestine, over vague personal anecdotes. I'm sure there were sick people in every country, who relished the 9/11 NYC attacks. (I'll remind you again that the majority of Palestinians in Gaza aren't even old enough to remember 9/11 or George Bush) There was also a lot of people who showed their support and sympathy to Americans with vigils -- including places like America's current-archenemy *Iran*. Does that cherry-picked example mean Iran is really best friends of USA? Of course not!

I've also seen videos of Americans marching in the streets with sw*astika flags and chanting ""Jews will not replace us"". Does this mean all Americans want a genocide of Jews and hate Israel? Not according to any reliable polling. Not according to the US government giving the all-time highest amount of cumulative aid to Israel.  

I've personally seen videos of hardline Israelis calling for genocide against Palestinians. Does that represent all Israelis? Does that delegitimize the right of the State of Israel to exist? I think you get the point by now.

Speaking of transactions, I appreciate that Israel knows that they need the US to give them billions in welfare checks every year, so when we tell you all to make sure the Gazans have water, you bend the knee and turn the water back on.

It's only going to get better because the boomers are on the way out and an October 11th poll showed that millennials and Gen Z have minority support for Israel. As millennials and Gen Z become more and more powerful, Israel will lose more and more welfare. Good luck!

edit: Also, you're probably going to get in a war with Iran and you can't shut their water off.

k70s5aa,1,"&gt;The current Israeli government doesn't. They've offered multiple two-state deals that were flatly rejected.

This just isn't a factual statement.

The first crucial steps in normalizing diplomacy between the PA and Israel were undertaken by Fatah and the Israeli Labor Party in 1993 - but they were put on hold after Netanyahu won office following the assassination of  Rabin in '95. Coincidentally, some of Netanyahu's campaign stunts included posters with images of Rabin in a set of crosshairs, and a mock funeral procession where pallbearers shouted ""Death to Rabin!"" while parading around a casket with Rabin's image posted onto it. Netanyahu was even made aware by Israel's security chief that there was a plot to kill Rabin, and was asked to please tone it down. *He refused.*

Fortunately, he wasn't in office very long the first time around, and negotiations were reopened under Ehud Barak.

The 2000 Camp David summit saw both sides being willing to make major compromises, but not enough to bridge the gap. There's plenty of blame to be placed on both Israel and the PA for the failure of the Camp David summit, though it's telling that Barak's Foreign Minister (who was present for the accord) stated that ""if I were Palestinian, I would also have rejected Camp David.""

But that wasn't the end of the peace process. They continued to meet and negotiate, with both sides proving willing to make even more concessions on what had been previously un-negotiable maximum demands, and by 2001 at Taba were *just about* to sign a viable, mutually agreeable two-state treaty.

But then Ehud Barak's term ran out, and the Likud party swept into office once more - and, once more, scrapped the plans and shut down negotiations.

The PA has, since '93, been extremely interested in finally coming to a negotiated settlement - much to its own detriment, as Palestinians become increasingly frustrated by the Israeli Right refusing to meet this diplomatic tack in good faith. They've not had a partner willing and able to meet with them for good faith negotiations in the Israeli gov't since 2001, though - and the Likud policy of seeking to consistently delegitimize and destabilize the PA is a major part of why we've arrived at the crisis we currently find ourselves in.",worldnews,2023-10-29 23:33:29+00:00

* In 1967, the Arab nations attacked again, and lost a significant amount of land. Israel gave back most of the land, but the Arabs still did not establish a state of Palestine.
* In 2000, in the Camp David talks, the Palestinians were given a new two-state proposal which they again rejected. They then launched the Second Intifada, fairly similar to what's happening now.

k70r8g0,1,"1. Heavily depopulated is a Zionist myth. It comes from the phrase ‚Äúa land without a people for a people without a land‚Äù there were arabs living in this region of Palestine which had been an Islamic country for over 1300 years before the British. A simple look into the ottoman registry called the Nufus. The ‚Äúunderpopulated‚Äù myth is blown up by the discussions of early Zionists, such as Chaim Weizmann, who when asked about the inhabitants of Palestine responded with: ‚ÄúThe British told us that there are there some hundred thousands negroes [Kushim] and for those there is no value.‚Äù.

2) the Jews weren‚Äôt promised ‚Äútiny bit of silver from a big land‚Äù. The belfour declaration showed intention to make Palestine one big Jewish state. Also why did you conveniently leave out the two state solution would be giving land not owned by the Jews to the Jews, including the best and most fertile land in the region along with most of the ports. It was a ripoff from day one and arabs were in their right to decline it

3) ‚Äúthe Palestinian identity was there wayyyyy before 1967. You‚Äôre using typical colonial arguments used against indigenous people in order to minimize their claim to the land. Take for example national identities such as ‚ÄúItalian‚Äù or ‚ÄúGerman‚Äù. These national identities are very recent, barely coming into existence at the end of the 1800s. Yet, nobody claims that Germans or Italians are a ‚Äúfake‚Äù people, despite their national identity not existing 200 years ago. Throughout history, peoples have often changed how they identified politically. The Sardinians eventually became Italians, Prussians became Germans. That doesn‚Äôt give you the right to say Palestine and palestinians didn‚Äôt exist so land theft is acceptable‚Ä¶

4. ‚ÄúYes they owned some of it but they didn‚Äôt govern it‚Äù because the Zionist British refused to give the indigenous Palestinians their own government. They helped overthrew the ottomans (which u fail to mention) in promise of their own recognized nation- just for British to refuse them government and bring in Jews in hopes of making Balfour declaration come true. Just because they weren‚Äôt allowed to have a government after the ottomans left doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt deserve to be in power.

5. The British were not ran out by arabs. Yes arabs were fighting zionists but in 1947 the zionists were fighting both arabs AND the British. 

6. To be clear, UNGA resolution 181 simply did NOT partition Palestine. It was only a partition plan, which was to be seen as a recommendation, and that the issue should be transferred to the Security Council. Israel was unilaterally declared by Zionist leadership in may 1948 by force while the Security Council was still trying to arrive at a conclusion. The plan was never implemented. And even if it was, there is nothing in the UN charter that confers such authority to the United Nations. So this means israel was created through conquest, which has been illegal since 1945. 

7. ‚ÄúThey agreed to share the land while colonial arabs disagreed‚Äù COLONIAL NATIVES YOU SAY?? It is unanimously agreed upon that the Jews are settlers and that Palestinian arabs are the natives of the land. This is how the British, the UN among others legally define these terms. Also- if arabs are the ‚Äúcolonialists‚Äù (who‚Äôve been the majority of the land for milleniums)- how many immigrated there??? How many Jews were in Palestine before the mandate??? Less than 50% of the population, the VAST majority of whom just immigrated, wanted half the land. the arabs have a legal right to refuse this. 

8. Not every country disobeys international law even tho international organizations favour Israeli interests over the internet‚Äôs of the native Palestinians. Not every country conquers another after conquest becomes illegal. Not every country was founded on genocide and ethnic cleansing",IsraelPalestine,2023-10-29 23:27:15+00:00

Egypt has backed Israel‚Äôs blockade of Gaza since Hamas took over in the territory in 2007, tightly controlling the entry of materials and the passage of civilians back and forth.

1. First off, WW2 predates Geneva Conventions and was extremely brutal for civilian populations. The French Resistance knew this and still tried to separate themselves from civilians as much as possible when they carried out their attacks. Still, it would not have been a war crime under the GC for Germany to cause collateral damage attacking the French Resistance. Using human shields and hiding among civilians is a war crime. Collateral damage among those civilians isn't.

2. If Hamas fires laser guided bombs, they can easily attack that building and only that building. That is what Israel does. Unfortunately for Palestine, Hamas hides their war assets in civilian buildings like hospitals (proof above) because they want as many civilians dead as possible because that's bad for Israel

Point taken. However, drawing direct parallels between these histories and the Israeli-Palestinian situation oversimplifies the unique circumstances and timelines of each.

While we can acknowledge historical wrongs globally, it's crucial to approach each situation in its context. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is relatively recent, with many of the displaced people still alive today. The immediacy of the pain and ongoing nature of the conflict makes it different from cases where the colonized or displaced populations were integrated, marginalized, or eradicated centuries ago.

Acknowledging the historical context of other countries shouldn't preclude us from striving for justice and peaceful coexistence in the present-day Israeli-Palestinian context.

k70qarb,1,"&gt;That‚Äôs not true actually, the region was called ‚ÄúBritish mandate for Palestine ‚Äú 


Palastine is a colonial name. Invented by the Roman emperor Hadrian .  There wasn't any palastinian kingdom , state or country in the history of the world . The Palestinian flag is the pan arabist  of the bhattist party .  Arabs. Didn't identify as palastinians until 1964 , they identified as Arabs or either Egyptians  , syrians , or jordenians to be more specific . 


&gt;and naturally a Palestinian state would have been established after the end of the British colonization

Accept Arabs refused a palastinian state in 1948 in favor of building a pan arabist state including Jewish owned land in Israel and they kept refusing for indipendece until 1988

&gt;Palestinians didn‚Äôt get that right bcs another occupation happened soon after

There wasn't another occupation

 there was a un offer to give the land both to Jews and Arabs . The Jews accepted and Arabs started a genocidal war and lost . The west bank was ruled by Jordan and Gaza by Egypt who lost it in 1967 to Israel 



&gt;that‚Äôs what am talking about they never got the chance to govern themselves


Palastinians absoultly got a chance to govern themselves . They had the grand mufti  haaj Amin El husseini in the 1920's -1950's who  was an Antisemite , a genocidal  maniac , and a close friend of Hitler .

The only area of the world then with high Jewish populations at the time in which large proportions of the non-Jewish populations were NOT ‚Äúanti-Semitic‚Äù as in ‚Äúanti-Jewish‚Äù (\*) was the Arab world. In the only Muslim country occupied by the Germans (Tunisia) Muslims concealed their Jewish compatriots from the Nazis (hence why the Germans could not capture most). Damascus, Baghdad and Cairo had huge Jewish populations since centuries ‚Ä¶ who only spoke Arabic‚Ä¶. and felt totally integrated (in Iraq there had been Jewish members of the cabinet). Furthermore, many Jewish refugees went to Palestine, and got accepted. In fact after 1947 it took false flag operations(blaming your action on someone else), Moroccan Jews did not want to leave Morocco; they were ‚ÄúHelped‚Äù by provocations which were largely fabricated outside Morocco (guess by who?). Iraqi Jews were coerced by Israel during the Baghdad bombings  


 The baghdad bombings for those of you who don't know:  
 (1950-1951) was a series of False-flag bombings on Jewish targets in Baghdad with the intention to encourage Iraqi Jews to immigrate to Israel. According to Moshe Gat, Meir-Glitzenstein, Samuel Klausner, Rayyan Al-Shawaf and Yehouda Shenhav, there is wide consensus among Iraqi Jews that the Zionists were behind the bombings. This belief was shared among Historian Abbas Shiblak, Iraqi Jew Naeim Giladi, CIA agent Wilbur Crane and the British Embassy of Baghdad. When the 'Lavon Affair False-flag operations (1954)' broke out, Shalom Cohen (Knesset Israeli Politician at a later stage) remarked, ""This method of operating was not invented for Egypt. It was tried before in Iraq."" In a 2006 publication, Yehuda Tager, an Israeli agent who operated in Baghdad, confirmed Zionist involvements in the bombings.

I would also like to point out that it was the Muslims/Arabs who returned the Jews to Jerusalem in the first place after Khalid ibn al walid(RA) and Omar al Khattab(RA) took it over from the Chrisitans, [Roy Cassandra talks through it well in this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5cL11dps4Y).  


Your notion that the Jews did not have it well before 1948 in the Arab world is wrong, before 1948 Jews, Christians and Muslims all lived together in peace. Muslims even held the keys to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and open its doors every morning and close them every night, it has been described as a ""great honour"" by the 2 families who hold the keys.

and to answer your questions:  
 \- How can people hold onto faith, when it compels to hate:

k70prt4,1,"I would like to disagree with the argument that because Israel was supported by rich white powerful people, that it thereby somehow makes it a colonial settlement. Which, will you haven't used the word colonialism yourself, could perhaps be inferree. Nonetheless, it is clear that the Zionist movement required money and global support but that shouldn't make it any less of a ""viable"" settlement in and of itself.

I do agree however, that the British were more sympathetic towards the Jews than towards the Arabs (evident perhaps as an example by the Balfour declaration as opposed to the houssein-mcmahon correspondences). The Brits did sort of try to take a U-turn in the late 1930s but it was clear that they wanted nothing more to do with the region. 

The Palestinians were treated unjustly. There are many reasons that I can expand on if you wish. In part because they didn't understand the importance (ultimately, out of understandingly no need) of forming a national movement for a long time. Perhaps in part because the Zionist movement was created by Europeans whom the Brits found it ""easier"" to trust (look up: racism). In part because of the Holocaust and the guilt European nations felt.

That's not to say the Palestinians are victims and did everything right. But it is clear they hold less power, yet still, no less than Israel, deserve to have freedom and their own country alongside.

I can assure you however, that this is not a matter of who's blame. I'm a historian. I'm also an atheist. And an Israeli. And I don't know if I can bear to live in Israel much longer. I'm saying this, because nonetheless, I do think there is some special need for a homeland for Jewish people; it really is unique and hard to explain. 

I wish we were accepted wherever we went, history and unfortunately even the present (for example the recent Russia lynch attempts) cast fear into being a Jew, simply because I was born as such.

Ultimately, while it is of historical significance there will never be a strict answer of who's to blame. History is more complex than that. It is my perspective however that no one should hold others accountable when it is clear that their plate is not empty. It just doesn't matter. Do you think any problem will be solved if we blame the ottomans? Or the Brits? Oe the Nazis? Or cold war proxy wars? 

Blaming someone else has never done any good to a nation. Look at Germany after WW2, did they blame the Versailles agreements? Or Hitler himself? No, it took them perhaps a while, but they accepted the horrific things they've done, and came to terms with them, and decided to walk a different path while not forgetting the past.

Both sides need to look inside, acknowledge what they have done wrong, and choose to walk a new road, to form a better future. Unfortunately now it seems so unlikely, it truly hurts to say, my heart legit physically aches thinking of the countless civilians that continue to die and will die in the future.",IsraelPalestine,2023-10-29 23:17:29+00:00
k70prmo,1,It's funny how quickly the UN loses legitimacy among some people.,worldnews,2023-10-29 23:17:27+00:00
k70prnx,1,"Britain engaged in the McMahon-Hussein Correspondence with the Arabs , hinting at support for an Arab-led state in return for assistance against the Ottoman Empire during World War I. However, the exact territorial bounds of this promise were not clearly defined. Then, the British issued the Balfour Declaration in 1917, expressing support for a ""national home for the Jewish people"" in Palestine but with the caveat that the rights of existing non-Jewish communities would not be prejudiced.

This dual commitment by Britain ‚Äî first to the Arabs, then to the Jews ‚Äî sowed seeds of tension and conflict between Arabs and Jews in Palestine.   


In1947, the UN proposed a partition plan, aiming to create separate Jewish and Arab states from British Mandate Palestine. The Jewish leadership accepted this plan, but the Arab leadership, feeling sidelined and concerned about the implications, rejected it. This rejection did not deter the Jewish leadership, who declared the State of Israel in 1948, prompting the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.

At least 700,000 Palestinians faced displacement, an event now known as the Nakbah. This event deepened the schism between Israelis and Palestinians.

In wrapping up, while the essence of these events may seem straightforward, they're embedded in layers of historical, political, and cultural complexities. To genuinely progress towards peace, we must delve deep into these layers, understanding and acknowledging the nuances of the past.",IsraelPalestine,2023-10-29 23:17:27+00:00
k70pr5q,1,"1) Bombing are a precursor to the ground offensive. That‚Äôs how war is waged in every battle. Yes, it helps Israeli troops advance towards the bunkers, command posts and tunnels where Hamas gunmen live. ( Edit: in spite of what you think, no carpet bombing is taking place. Beyond everything, it‚Äôs a waste of munition. Majority of strikes are with precision guided bombs) 

2) The Hamas leaders (not a new approach) live far away in safely. No people should agree to this ‚Äúarrangement‚Äù, but it seems Palestinians have no issue with it. 

3) Why would these leaders call for a ceasefire? I can‚Äôt see even one reason. For them the people are expendable, cannon fodder for achieving their goal. 

4) Only recently (from the safety of his apartment in Qatar, in an interview to Saudi TV), Khalid Mashaal declared that liberty is achieved with sacrifices.  Palestinians (not him obviously) are willing to sacrifice. So for now, he recommends young Palestinians to sacrify themselves. (aka Allah needs Shahids)‚Ä¶ I think it‚Äôs a noble cause. 

Only I‚Äôd change the order: let Khalid Mashaal, Yahia Sinwar, Ismail Haniyeh, etc, etc, blow themselves first (to show example) and only later others will follow. How about that?

https://youtu.be/gkZDxJ3JhCA?si=mK-l7fdPsyjdTUyI

Edit: even you can understand (if you try) that Gaza is connected with a network of tunnels (a huge expense - with money that should have gone to the poor population). Entrance to the tunnels is often from inside buildings. So they can fire RPGs, machine guns, etc from the top floor of a building, disappear into a tunnel, then pop up on another side of Gaza. All these plans are courtesy of Ayatollah (with love).

Edit 2: There are thousands of Hamas gunmen, assailants, communication officers, suppliers of munitions and food. 

Since the claim is that they don‚Äôt ‚Äúrepresent‚Äù the population, I was wondering who these people are? On 10/7 a mob invaded Israel (the details are well known). But were these foreigners? Japanese? Mongols? Shaolin monks perhaps? No! These are the sons, brothers, husbands, fathers, neighbors of the people they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt represent‚Äù‚Ä¶",IsraelPalestine,2023-10-29 23:17:21+00:00

Israel has a very long history of targeting civilians, committing war crimes.  The WHO records attacks on hospitals and healthcare workers within Palestine.

For all anyone knows Israel killed many of the concert goers in the crossfire during that initial attack.  Israel could have killed the children with tank shells thats been widely reported throughout the media, there has been no independent investigation by the United Nations.

Its not like Israel does not fabricate evidence, because they do.  They did in 2009 with the al fakhura school.

2: A father and two sons (roughly 7 &amp; 9) running for their lives in their underwear into what appears to be a bomb shelter with an open entrance. A Hamas terrorist throws a hand grenade into shelter, killing the father, and badly injuring the two sons who run back into the house

3: Hamas terrorists enter a house, where a small girl is seen hiding under the table. After some talking back and forth they shoot and kill her as she hides under the table. Hard to say how old she is but looks like 7-9 years old.
4: Hamas terrorists setting fire to a house in a kibbutz. 

5: A beheaded Israeli soldier. 

6: Photo of dead baby and child burned beyond recognition.

7: Scores of dead people on the road after Hamas executed them in their cars. Yelling Allahu Akhbah. 

8: Hamas terrorist calling his parents: ‚ÄúI killed 10 Jews with my own hands. I‚Äôm using the dead Jewish woman‚Äôs phone to call you now.‚Äù The mother says ‚ÄúMay god protect you.‚Äù

1. The lack of sufficient power in Gaza for desalination. Fixing this issue alone would make Gaza easily have a water surplus. 
2. The Israeli permit system which prevents construction and repair of water facilities.

For some bizarre reason, the West and the UN seem only to care about atrocities committed against other countries and turn a humongous blind eye to atrocities committed against countries' own civilians. 

This is why H\*tler keeps getting brought up over and over and over again (rightly so) for killing approx 6 million Jews, yet no-one seems to care to the same level that anywhere between 28 - 126 million civilians were killed by the Soviet Communist Party, and anywhere between 40 - 80 million Chinese were killed under Mao, because all of these atrocities were committed by governments agains their own citizens so UN doesnt seem to care. 

Same reason applies to why Hamas has yet to be condemmed by the UN for depriving its citizens of basic essentials like electricity and water. Hamas digs up water pipes that Israel builds in order to supply water to Gaza and uses the materials to build their rockets to fire at Israel, essentially depriving their own citizens from the basic human right to have access to water and the UN is silent as a hawk.

Did they have a big building in the desert that said ""this is our HQ"" ??

k70lku4,1,"In case it was removed by autmod because of the word for male genitalia:


Just because I was raised in Israel doesn't mean I ""swallow up propaganda"". You know nothing about me. The most important humanitarian organizations reporting about the situation in Gaza and the west bank are Israeli. Does that mean their evaluation should immediately be dismissed?

Additionally, I think I present a fairly nuanced take on the conflict, so even if you think I'm wrong, perhaps you'll learn something new.


The notion that you're not even going to put time into educating yourself on this subject, but here you are preaching to me, is ridiculous. You don't have to be israeli nor Palestinian to comment on the matter, but you do have to do some research and attempt to understand both sides.

Still, I hope that something in you also wants to listen. I will do my best to address your point.

Regarding your points;

1. There are a lot of racists in Israel, religious ultra nationalists who support the superiority of Jews over other religions and ethnicities. I deeply condemn it. People like Ben Gvir and Smotritch who are in power concern me deeply. Nethanyau is also a racist piece of shit. There are also a lot of racist Palestinians who want to eradicate Jews off the face of the earth.

Unfortunately when you live in a region that is filled with so much tension a lot of radical opinions form. Doesn't mean one shouldn't condemn it. I am doing so, and will always do so, especially against racist Israelis, it is despicable.

2. I'm not going to refer much to the claims of ghettoing or genocide. I've tackled those above. But in short, they are unsubstantiated and completely wrong and are only used to try and paint the conflict as black or white.

3. I suggest you don't compare my suffering with others. This isn't a male genital measuring contest for suffering. The Palestinians have suffered more, and still do, I wrote it already. That doesn't take away from my suffering, and ultimately it doesn't matter. 

The notion that one side isn't suffering enough is ridiculous, if more Israeli people die will that satisfy you? If it were 10000 dead Israelis and ""only"" 5000 dead Palestinians would we be ok and moral?

My point is that the creation of Israel as Jewish majority state would not have happened without white European money and power. So it is in fact a settler creation.   


No, it doesn't change the facts of everything else you've stated. But it does mean that a group of people with less power than the settlers (Palestinians) were treated unjustly for the sake of a Jewish safe haven. I don't blame Jews for being given such an opportunity by the guilt ridden Europeans.

No ‚Äúnationalist‚Äù Jewish historian has ever tried to conceal the well-known fact that conversions to Judaism had a major impact on Jewish history in the ancient period and in the early Middle Ages. Although the myth of an exile from the Jewish homeland (Palestine) does exist in popular Israeli culture, it is negligible in serious Jewish historical discussions. Important groups in the Jewish national movement expressed reservations regarding this myth or denied it completely.

k70kp29,2,"&gt; Ukrainians were Nazis though? 

When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, Ukraine greeted them as liberators because of the horrific abuse they had suffered under Stalin, including a deliberate famine that killed millions.  However, the Germans considered Ukrainians just as sub-human as they considered the Russians to be and treated them accordingly.  Thus Ukraine increasingly turned against Germany--there were Ukrainian partisan groups and Ukrainian units within the Red Army.  That some lingering association with Nazism has survived in Ukraine is not surprising, the same thing has happened in many European nations including Russia itself.  Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, Croatia and so on, all have neo-Nazi movements.

However, note that there is a difference between Ukrainians being pro-German when they briefly thought the German army was liberating them in 1941, and Ukrainians actually adhering to Nazi ideology.  Even most Germans were not members of the Nazi Party while that party was in power.  Antisemitism is another issue, the Nazis had little trouble finding local helpers in the nations they conquered when it came to rounding up Jews and shipping them off to death camps.",PublicFreakout,2023-10-29 22:43:38+00:00
